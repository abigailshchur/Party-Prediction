 ok
 yeah that's not any part of HB2.........
 requiring drivers to wear safety belts doesn't outlaw people from driving
 actually UberEats won't deliver to my side of downtown so joke's on you
 the taxis are only relevant in sense that TNCs agreed to follow standards 2 years ago and now they're going back on word
 no one here is defending taxis, I use Uber regularly b/c they are way better. Doesn't mean FP is a bad idea.
I love telling people to go to El Arroyo &amp; Torchy's that way all the good places in town aren't busy hahahahaha 
Comparison where people (drivers) agree w/ new regulation but corps./GOP (Lyft/Troxclair) oppose hmmmm what is it  
My fave part of last night was someone saying FP for drivers = #HB2 restrictions on abortion clinics, y'all are the best #txlege #atxcouncil
Uber/Lyft turned simple regulatory idea taxis &amp;  follow = "outlaw"\n\ngreat PR, totally bogus but great PR 
    From a labor perspective if you drive for a TNC, fingerprints work to your advantage in
 The TNC item passes on a vote of 9-2. The ordinance that was passed can be seen here: 
 #atxcouncil passes ordinance requiring driver fingerprint background checks for ride-hailing apps. Many details to be worked out.
 nays:   #atxcouncil #atxgov
 TNC regs pass yeas: 9 #atxcouncil #atxgov
#atxcouncil should consider doing a Doodle poll to figure out when the various dates are set for this ordinance, may be faster
  told me that he surprised himself with that one, Me too \xbd #StillGotIt Great team win #RedNation #Purs
(on how many drivers work for multiple TNCs)\n\nyeah - makes sense, an interesting wrinkle in this 
   IME, # is going down over time as some drivers pick one and stick to it.
 meant how many people drive for both, sorry was unclear. I'd say ~1/3 of drivers I talk to drive for both, but that's anecdotal
#KeepAustinPossible  
 b/c independence day: resurgence gonna be cooler
I missed first part of this convo, was there any discussion about number of drivers who work for uber &amp; lyft #atxcouncil
 sadly....this is not unusual
 CM Tovo is making amendments to section 13-2-527 in this ordinance document:  #atxcouncil

sweet, I'm for it 
Cameras in every bus + handicap access, u want every TNC doing that too or u done w/ this comparison #atxcouncil

y'all keep telling me what I think/do about all this, its real entertaining 
well Acevedo said background checks w/ fingerprints is best so......... #atxcouncil  
tell that to  they have a great biz model and follow these regs no problem 
effed up - I said ppl should be empathetic when talking 'bout assault data, don't worry these dudes set me straight 
 Acevedo reiterates that both fingerprinting and background checks would be best, but doesn't believe one is no good w/
 as  just pointed out, we still haven't gotten to meat of this whole thing: what's in the ord. #atxcouncil #atxgov
TNCs don't have to leave, they choose to leave we act like we're forcing them to do something #atxcouncil
my original point in thread was folks talking only about data and not recognizing unreported cases are insensitive 
 you said someone was withholding data, i was just pointing out no one was
Oh come on Troxclair, riders aren't the ones providing the service this is a horrible analogy/convo, gimme a break #atxcouncil
no one is withholding they talked about it  
those who work w/ assault victims, have experience see past reported data, say this is what they want I follow them

 no, I did not. I did notice that the GOP-controlled Congress can't even pass a jobs bill, though. You notice that?
 tough to improve median hh income, or stagnant wage growth, when all measures to fix income inequality are blocked by GOP
 small business policies (there's like 5-6 - re: microloans, reduced regulations, etc.) are ongoing through today.
 saving the auto industry still helps today. a stimulus that pumped $$ into renewable industry still helps today.
Reminder about this - for context in today's jobs report 
 In rejecting #KeystoneXL, Obama said the U.S. is leading on climate change.  
 again - I named 4 of 'em. You just don't care.
Have so many GOP friends that are completely reasonable to talk/debate with. Wish they were on Twitter more. Bah.
Just named 4 and you didn't care. Happy to have honest exchange but you have no interest in that, so....bye. 
 so no, it's not that I can't answer your question, it's that I don't want to waste my whole morning on ridiculous nonsense
 i completely understand the limited impact any president, D or R, has on jobs. but to just dismiss Obama's role outright = BS
 just blanketly saying he's done nothing w/o having to defend it is not courageous. it's trolling.
 the fact that he bailed out the auto industry, which was a top performer today
 I can go through any number of small business loan policies he's implemented that's helped out folks in rural communities

  (3) council should have at least adopted Casar's proposal to also spend $$ helping out w/ rental assistance
  (2) we're giving special privilege priority to this over roads, housing, land use, &amp; other affordability issues
  (1) $1/month for some ATX districts to help w/ "affordability" = even worse posturing than the TX Senate
  starts at 6%, will scale up to 20% within 4 years. Just changed the rates; will figure how to pay for it later
  Casar had a good proposal to provide some relief for rentals last night. hope it comes back up soon.
  fwiw, I'm sure it will happen. But it should happen for other services, and we should protect renters while we do.

 well, ultimately - who gave the "whisky" to the kids? The parents? Who gave tax $ to govt? The voters. So...MQS mad at voters?

  (1/2) you began this by comparing those in Bastrop to people worried about cops killing innocent people
  well, it seems like "this" - Jade Helm - isn\'t anything 
  OK. How are concerns that something *may* happen a humanitarian crisis?
  Isn't the Guard supposed to be protecting the border from ISIS? They can only chase so many ghosts at once...
  and at some point, this endless fear of the federal govt needs to be met with reality, not sympathy

"Excuse me, I\'m like John Boehner. I cry when things are close to my heart." Light moment before devastating testimony. #txlege #HB3785
Not the "last" last witnesses up. Just the two previous witnesses. #txlege
Last two witnesses up: a veteran, w/ expertise on PTSD, and woman with the Katy Tea Party. Both support #HB3785. #txlege
"Whole plant medical marijuana is a safe and effective treatment...continuing to make that illegal is the real crime." #txlege #HB3785

#SJR39 is about letting Missourians decide which religious freedoms are guaranteed in our state constitution. #moleg\n
I had the chance to meet the Missouri  Youth of the Year Award finalists today. Congratulations to all! 
Why are opponents of #SJR39 so afraid to let the people of Missouri decide? Why are they trying to silence them? #moleg
Opponents of #SJR39 mischaracterize it as deciding the issue. It does not change the law. It only provides Missouri's voters a voice. #moleg
 Lt Governor  originally worked to pass #RFRA in MO, supporting #religiousfreedom and #sjr39. 
 "#SJR39 is another piece of the fabric of religious liberties that every American enjoys."  #moleg
#SJR39 is about letting Missourians decide which religious freedoms are guaranteed in our state constitution. #moleg 
#SJR39 is about one issue: Should #MO voters decide if our constitution should allow specific protections for religious liberties? #moleg

 It's a great day to be a Republican in Missouri  #GOP  
We must focus on increasing funding for FQHCs so that all Missourians have access to quality health care regardless of income. #mogov
Missourians who live in rural areas deserve the same access to health care as everyone else in Missouri. #mogov
We need strong leadership to take us on a U-turn from the liberal course Gov. Nixon and AG Koster put us on. #mogov

I've made clear that I'm willing to work with anyone of good will, championing issues that make a difference. #mogov\n
Expanding Medicaid is unaffordable, it is unworkable, it will break Missouri's bank, and we are not going to do it. #mogov
Happy Easter from our family to yours. He has Risen!

 #mogov 
As Lt. Governor, I stepped up to address these issues and provided effective leadership. As\xc2\xa0#mogov, I will continue\xc2\xa0#FightingForMissouri.
The mob mentality that took place during the\xc2\xa0#Ferguson\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0#Mizzou\xc2\xa0unrest is not an acceptable form of governance.\xc2\xa0#mogov

I won't stop #FightingForMissouri. And I won't stop fighting for #Mizzou. Let's restore our state &amp; school to its highest potential. #mogov
Let's enhance support systems for students - academic support. Meant to help students excel in the classroom and real world.
Instead, #Mizzou should be refining curriculum aimed at preparing students for the workforce. No more classes on Harry Potter &amp; 
No more of these failed efforts to appease the PC crowd. Millions have been spent on these programs. TO WHAT END?
#Mizzou lists 30 unique diversity offices/programs/centers. Students now demand MILLIONS MORE in funding for NEW offices/programs/centers.
Click's behavior landed her paid leave while waiting on her impending tenure. I applaud our legislature for their work to remove her.
Ms. Click also has a penchant for disregarding constitutional freedoms and disrespecting the law enforcement officers sworn to protect her.
Melissa Click has been at #Mizzou since 2003, receiving funding to research topics like reality TV, Lady Gaga and 50 Shades of Grey.
Since November, the University has been a punch-line, a joke told in the context of blatant disregard of the role of governance.
Enough is enough. Faux outrage &amp; baseless claims are tearing Mizzou's reputation apart - there are real social justice issues to focus on.
The #Mizzou crisis has endured for months. It's not getting better. Real leaders must stand up &amp; fight. Here's the truth, no sugar-coating:
Today, I am calling for a thorough  investigation to ensure that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated in Missouri. #mogov
I wholeheartedly condemn this anti-Muslim behavior. There is no place for hate crime in Missouri.  #mogov

Now joining Wake Up Columbia with Branden Rathert on  to talk Nixon's #LastSOTS. Listen live   #MOSOTS
Speaker  #MOGOPResponse brought to light the actual problems Missouri faces  ones that Gov. Nixon glossed over tonight.
We can't afford four more years of Nixon's liberal agenda, and that's exactly what we would get with Chris Koster. #MOSOTS
Chris Koster stood by every one of Nixon's failed liberal policies he laid out tonight in his #LastSOTS #MOSOTS 
There is no time for platitudes. It's time to get things done. Missouri needs a fighter  
This is just another unilateral attempt by Nixon to bypass Missouri voters and pursue his own goals. \n\nSound familiar,  #MOSOTS
Governor Nixon also failed to mention that he wasted $16 million of YOUR taxpayer money on a stadium that will never be built. #MOSOTS
Missouri needs a Governor who will maintain law and order and respond to crisis - not hide until it passes. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
Governor Nixon also brought a #Ferguson to the  campus, allowing students and football players to take university hostage. #LastSOTS
Nixon let cities burn when he kowtowed to Obama and pulled back the National Guard where it was needed most. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
No surprise - Gov. Nixon failed to mention his inaction and legacy of failure in Ferguson. Where is the leadership? #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
To truly choose action we must stay true to Missouri's conservative values. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
Governor Nixon forgot to mention eight years of his failed liberal policies. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
Are we going to hear  explain his legacy of failure in dealing with crisis situations - #Ferguson or #Mizzou? #MOSOTS #LastSOTS
We must reject federal overreach programs like Common Core and return control to the local level. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS #mogov
The liberal agenda in Jefferson City vetoed school choice and educational freedom. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
Washington, D.C. and Jefferson City don't know what your children need. You do. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
This begins with unwavering support of our brave peace officers who put their lives on the line for our safety. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
Under Governor Nixon's leadership, St. Louis homicides increased 18% in 2015 alone. #mogov needs new leadership. #LastSOTS #MOSOTS
First steps toward funding  Fiscally responsible spending in state government and rebuilding trust with #MO taxpayers. #LastSOTS
Indiana gained tens of thousands of new jobs and billions of dollars in investment thanks to Right to Work. When is it our turn? #LastSOTS
Governor Nixon has done nothing to create job opportunity in #MO. He sits idle as Right-to-Work states flourish. #LastSOTS
Quality jobs are leaving the state of Missouri. We need Right to Work to bolster our economy. #LastSOTS
FACT: #MO labor participation rate is at its lowest since 1977. A low unemployment rate is not enough. #LastSOTS 
RETWEET if you're excited this is Governor Nixon's #LastSOTS. 
Gov. Nixon: Last year you blamed a struggling #MO economy on environmental permitting. What's your excuse going to be this year? #LastSOTS
I'm preparing my response to tonight's #LastSOTS. My staff will be live tweeting the address. Stay tuned! #MOSOTS #mogov
A $3M line of credit with no taxpayer input. This was mishandled from the start. #mogov needs accountability.
